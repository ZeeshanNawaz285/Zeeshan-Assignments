				Assignment  Networking 

1. Given these requirements Base address: 142.150.235.0
     Network mask: 255.255.255.224 Broadcast address:
    142.150.235.31 Reserved Router address: 142.150.235.1
a) What is the address of the assigned sub network and what is the 
     extended network prefix?
b) Which IP addresses can I use to configure the computers in my 
    lab?
c) Suppose I wanted to do subdivide the assigned address block into 
    4 smaller sub networks of equal size. How large are these 
    networks, and how many IP addresses can I assign in each sub \\ 
    network?
2. Consider the 128.100.112.0/21 block of IP addresses. This block
    of addresses must be divided into four sub networks that have 
    each at least 500 IP addresses.


Ans : 1 (a)
	
	network mask 255.255.255.224
	in binary : 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
	1 is a network bits & 0 is a host bits 
	so 27 bits reserve for network and 5 bits reserve for host
	142.150.235.0/27 

(b) 
	the number of host bits is 5    (host(h)=5)
	(2 power h)-2 =(2 power 5)-2 =32-2 = 30 host
 	2 ip is reserved so the range is 
	142.150.235.2    to     142.150.235.30

(c)
  	subnet 1:     142.150.235.0/29
	subnet 2:     142.150.235.64/29
            subnet 3:     142.150.235.128/29
            subnet 4:      142.150.235.192/29


Ans 2:

	subnet 1:	128.100.112.0/23      to      128.100.113.255/23
	subnet 2:	128.100.114.0/23      to      128.100.115.255/23
	subnet 3:	128.100.116.0/23      to      128.100.117.255/23
	subnet 4:	128.100.118.0/23      to      128.100.119.255/23






3. An organization is assigned a class C network address of 201.35.2.0. It
    uses a netmask of 255.255.255.192. Using this netmask
a) How many subnets can be created. What are the address of the 
    assigned subnetworks?
b) In each subnet, how many IPs each subnet will have

4. An organization is assigned a class C network address of 201.35.2.0. It
    uses a netmask of 255.255.255.192 to divide this into sub-networks.  
    Which of the following is/are valid host IP addresses?
     A) 201.35.2.129
    B) 201.35.2.191
     C) 201.35.2.255

5. An organization has a class C network address of 201.32.64.0. It uses
    a subnet mask of 255.255.255.248. Which of the following is NOT a   
    valid broadcast address for any subnetworks?
     a) 201.32.64.135
     b) 201.32.64.240
     c) 201.32.64.207
     d) 201.32.64.231

Ans 3: (a)
 	
	netmask : 255.255.255.192
	in binary :11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
	number of host bits is 6.
            2 power 6 = 64 

	201.35.2.0
	201.35.2.64
	201.35.2.128
	201.35.2.192
  
(b)

	 2 power 6 = 64-2 = 62  IP in each subnet 

Ans 4:
            (a & c) 201.35.2.129 and 201.35.2.255

	subnet 1:         201.35.2.0		201.35.2.63
	subnet 2:	201.35.2.64		201.35.2.127
	subnet 3:	201.35.2.128		201.35.2.191
	subnet 4:	201.35.2.192		201.35.2.256

Ans 5 :
	 b) 201.32.64.240
